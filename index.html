          Björk recently gave a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, accompanied by a string ensemble and received great acclaim. Björk is an artist constantly experimenting with new expressions by introducing cutting edge technology to her music. She believes that the latest VR technology can connect her and the audience intimately; in a different way than CDs or live concerts could, it is a new type of private theatre that provides an appropriate sense of one on one solitude for you to experience music as never before. Björk’s “heartbreak saga” album“Vulnicura” was born from the extremely personal event that it is to break up with someone, and then turned that into VR for this exhibition, “Björk Digital” –an on-going project that explores the possibilities of VR and music.

  	   This exhibition also allows you to interactively experience the multimedia album “Biophilia”; An album with songs turned into applications that is being used in the educational curriculum in Scandinavia, whose theme is the confluence of nature, music and technology. Additionally, 29 songs from Björk’ career have been remastered in 5.1ch sound especially for this exhibition. You can enjoy them in chronological order in the Cinema Room. Björk says “an artist’s work is to put soul into technology”. That is certainly achieved in this exhibition that has already travelled to Australia, Japan and in October to Somerset House in London. The Björk Digital show in Harpa is the largest edition of the show and includes it´s newest addition, Family Room.
